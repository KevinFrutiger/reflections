What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates the repository in the .git folder. I need to make the initial commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is where I change the files. The repository is the tracked index of changes. The staging area is a place to organize my commits. It allows me to choose what I'm updating in the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can add only the files that are part of the logical change to the staging area.
