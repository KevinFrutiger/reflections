When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when collaborating with others, or creating an open-source codebase
- as a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you'll know when your repo has changed

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a clone created on GitHub's server, which is separate from the original but retains information about the original. A clone is a local copy of the remote repo. A branch is a commit label.
