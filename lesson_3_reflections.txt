When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when collaborating with others, or creating an open-source codebase
- as a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you'll know when your repo has changed
