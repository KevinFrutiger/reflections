When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when collaborating with others, or creating an open-source codebase
- as a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you'll know when your repo has changed

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a clone created on GitHub's server, which is separate from the original but retains information about the original. A clone is a local copy of the remote repo. A branch is a commit label.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows you to compare your last known state with the remote, and revert to it if need be (vs your local commits).
