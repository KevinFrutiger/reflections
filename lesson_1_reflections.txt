How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It isolated what had changed, which reduced the number of lines I had to look at to find a possible error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It means I can readily diff changes, and I don't have to spend time making manual copies (and possibly get confused which is current).

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google Docs is designed for creating a document, be it a paper, spreadsheet, or what not. Git is general designed for coding, so it's useful to treat edits across multiple documents as a single change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
I can use git log to see a list of each commit with its id and message. Using git log --stat will tell me some details on the number of changes. git diff old new will list out changes between each file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Not sure being confident in that is a good thing, actually. But, I can revert back to a previous commit if I break something.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Committing to a remote repo, since I've already been using it locally for my own projects.
